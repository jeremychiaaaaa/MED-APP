This is an online medical app built with React Native to show-case my front end mobile app development understanding 
<br/>
The concept of this app was to provide users with a multi-purpose health app where they can book appointments with specialists for consultations as well as upload all relavent travel documents to the app for storage.
<br/>
For the back-end, I made use of firebase and mainly firestore for user authentication, uploading documents as well as booking appointments.
<br/>
<br/>
The main features of the app are:
<br/>
1. User Sign Up and Authentication.

2. View doctors available.

3. Book and View appointments booked.

4. Upload Documents from phone and view them.
